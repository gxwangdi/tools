A simple program to help you decide which problem you want to review.

The general idea is that, the less recent problem will get bigger chances to get selected for review, and once a problem is reviewed, it is removed from the repository unless you init the repo again.

When running "init -new" command, it only check in problems you worked on with bigger last modified timestamp.

Command list: init -all scan all problems and init repo -new scan new problems and update repo -dir update problem repo dir next pick the next problem to review help print the command list quit quit and persist all problems into a file, which will be resumed the next time the program is up.
